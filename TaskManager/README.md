# TaskManager
Tool I made that emulates a planner/to-do-list. 

# Motivation
A lot of to-do-list apps are very bloated and require a lot of button pressing to interact with the agenda. 

I wanted to make a program that would immediately pull a task upon loading a list. I also wanted the user to be able to append and delete from the list without having to edit a text file via text editor and have the tasks immediately prioritized. A GUI makes easy tasks easier.

The goal is for the user to add tasks all in one sitting. They can add them in whatever order they want, with little to no organization. They will reference the list later to see a prioritized list of what they have to do.

# Features
Users can:

- Load different agenda files in `.txt` format
- Immediately see the most urgent task followed by all the tasks
- Add/Remove specific tasks
- Remove most urgent task once complete

Other features:

- Dark mode for night-time planning
- Help screen

# Installation

1. Download and install Java
2. Download and install Eclipse IDE for Java Developers
3. Follow [instructions on importing project from Git in Eclipse](https://youtu.be/38JFCqi_X3c)

# Usage

## Easiest Method (requires Eclipse IDE and JDK)

1. Open `TaskManager` project in Eclipse
2. Run project from main class `main.Main`

## Terminal Method (see Contribute)

# Contribute

Email me at <orlandorodriguezosr@protonmail.ch> if you are interested in contributing.

I am especially interested in creating an executable JAR file, or in adding Usage directions for people who want to use the terminal instead of Eclipse. Any help with these two goals would be greatly appreciated.

## To-Do

- Finish Help feature
- Finish dark mode feature
- Create JAR
- Create terminal instructions
